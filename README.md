# labs
* This is the CSC 143 code repository for class-01, class-02 and class-03 for Winter 2024.
* This repo contains the starter code that you will need to build components for your labs and projects for this course.

## Coding Assessment
Things that matter for (in order from highest to lowest):
* modular design and testing
* code must be readable and easy to understand without comments
* efficiency and simplicity
* reasonable and obvious elimination of code redundancy 
* limited comments (ONLY where necessary)
* solved the problem

## Class Components
Components of a Class must be listed in the following order:
* constants (grouped/alphabetical order)
* data fields (grouped/alphabetical order )
* constructors (in order of increasing parameters, then first parameter order)
* methods (alphabetical order)
* inner classes (alphabetical order)

## Coding Style
Your coding style should be consistent:
* braces should adhere to the default in IntelliJ, or the style in zyBooks
* use of vertical and horizontal white spaces are REQUIRED.
* vertical white spaces between methods should be one or two spaces.
* horizontal white spaces reading left to right should have at least one space between.
* use descriptive identifiers that show the usage of the variable, method, reference etc.
* use one-liners, if it leads to better readability and understanding of the implemented code.
* use action words to define your operation functionality(what they actually do!)
* use loops and/or methods to shorten lines of code that are repetitive.

### Writing Effective Code 
This assessment includes the following:
* were the listed instructions and checklist followed.
* how well action words were used for the methods/functions, and to define their functionality(what they actually do)
* how effect were your loops and/or methods were used to shorten lines of code that are repetitive.
* how well names were used to make understandable identifiers for methods, variables etc.
* how well code oneliners were used to give better readability and understanding of the code.
